# StraitsX-tokens (XIDR)

## Token Description
The StraitsX IDR (XIDR) token is the first digital token fully collateralized one-for-one with Indonesia Dollar (IDR) and representing 1 IDR. The XIDR token is written as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain following the ERC20 standard and is governed by the StraitsX network whereby XIDR tokens are centrally minted and burned by Xfers Pte. Ltd.

[Xfers](https://www.xfers.com/sg/) is an approved holder of a Major Payment Institution license ("MPI") for e-money issuance licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)

## Smart Contract Specifications
The XIDR contract has been written by the StraitsX team to fit both the specific needs of the XIDR token as described in the StraitsX Whitepaper and the requirement to comply with local regulation.

The XIDR contract consists of two communicating contracts:
- [token contract](https://github.com/Xfers/StraitsX-tokens/blob/master/Ethereum/XIDR/contracts/FiatTokenV1.sol)
- [proxy contract](https://github.com/Xfers/StraitsX-tokens/blob/master/Ethereum/XIDR/contracts/FiatTokenProxy.sol)

The token contract represents a standard fungible token contract with minting and burning features, while an [unstructured storage proxy pattern](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/proxies#unstructured-storage-proxies) is used for the proxy contract. This pattern enables the token contract to modify the storage of the proxy contract. Since the state resides on the proxy contract, one simply needs to point to a new token implementation for future upgrades.

And one multi-signature contract:
- [multi-signature contract](https://github.com/Xfers/StraitsX-tokens/blob/master/Ethereum/XIDR/contracts/MultiSigWallet.sol)

The multi-signature contract is a digital signature scheme which allows a group of users(owners) to submit, sign and execute transactions to the proxy contract.

## Token contract
### Roles and Privileges

| Name | Description & Privileges |
|--|--|
|`owner`| The current owner of the token contract. The `owner` handles critical administrative actions, e.g., determining which address plays which role in the token contract. There is only one `owner` and it is initialized by calling the `initialize()` function.|
|`pauser`| The current pauser of the token contract. The `pauser` is allowed to (un)pause the contract. There is only one `pauser` and it is initialized by calling the `initialize()` function.|
|`masterMinter`| The current master minter of the token contract. The `masterMinter` manages the minters and configures the number of tokens that each minter is allowed to mint. There is only one `masterMinter` and it is initialized by calling the `initialize()` function. |
|`minter`| A role that is allowed to mint and burn new tokens. The token contract defines several minters and the number of tokens that each minter is allowed to mint in the `minterAllowances` field. The `IncreaseMinterAllowance` transition is called by the `masterMinter` for adding a new `minter` by increasing the it's minterAllowance. There can be more than one `minter` in the token contract. |
|`blacklister`| The current blacklister of the token contract. The `blacklister` is used to (un)freeze & wipe the balance from any other account when required to do so by law enforcement. The presence of this function in the code is a mandatory regulatory requirement. StraitsX will never use this function on its own accord. There is only one `blacklister` and it is initialized by calling the `initialize()` function. |
|`msg.sender`| The address that initiated the function call. |

### Functions

All the functions in the contract can be categorized into four categories:
- _housekeeping functions meant to facilitate basic admin related tasks.
- _pause functions meant to pause and unpause the contract.
- _minting-related functions that allows mining and burning of tokens.
- _token transfer functions allows to transfer tokens from one user to another.

Each of these category of functions are presented in further details below:

## Proxy Contract

The proxy contract points to a contract implementation which it derives its logic from. You can understand more by reading this [detailed explanation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/proxies#unstructured-storage-proxies) or by going through their [documentation](https://docs.zeppelinos.org/docs/2.2.0/upgradeability_adminupgradeabilityproxy).

## Multi-signature Contract

The multi signature contract is the [same contract](https://github.com/gnosis/MultiSigWallet/blob/master/contracts/MultiSigWallet.sol) that is used by Gnosis.

This contract holds funds that can be paid out to arbitrary users, provided that enough people in the collection of owners sign off on the payout. The transaction must be added to the contract before signatures can be collected. Once enough signatures are collected, the transaction will automatically be executed and if successful, the money paid out.

If an owner changes his mind about a transaction, the signature can be revoked until the transaction is executed.

WARNING:

If a sufficient number of owners lose their private keys, or for any other reason are unable or unwilling to sign for new transactions, the funds in the wallet will be locked forever. It is therefore a good idea to set required_signatures to a value strictly less than the number of owners, so that the remaining owners can retrieve the funds should such a scenario occur.

If an owner loses his private key, the remaining owners should move the funds to a new wallet to ensure that funds are not locked if another owner loses his private key. The owner who originally lost his private key can generate a new key, and the corresponding address be added to the new wallet, so that the same set of persons own the new wallet.

### Multi-signature contract Roles and Privileges

| Name | Description & Privileges |
|--|--|
|`owners` | The users who own this contract. |

### Mutable Fields

The table below presents the mutable fields of the contract and their initial values.

| Name | Type| Description |
|--|--|--|
|`transactions`|`mapping (uint => Transaction)`| To track the transactions that are added onto the multisig wallet.|
|`confirmations`|`mapping (uint => mapping (address => bool))`| To track which transactions have been confirmed by which owner.|
|`isOwner`|`mapping (address => bool)`| To which addresses are owners in this multisig.|
|`owners`|`address[]`| An optimization to track the existing owners in the multisig.|
|`required`|`uint`| The number of signatures required per transaction.|
|`transactionCount`|`uint`| The number of transactions created to date. This also acts as a unique identifier for each transaction as it can only increase.|

### Functions

All the functions in the contract can be categorized into two categories:
- _housekeeping functions_ to add, remove, replace owners and change number of signatures required.
- _action functions_ let owners create and execute transactions, sign and revoke signatures.


#### Housekeeping functions

| Name | Params | Description |
|--|--|--|
|`addOwner`| `owner : address` | To add `owner` address as a new owner of the multisig contract. |
|`removeOwner`| `owner : address` | To remove `owner` address as one of the owners of the multisig contract. |
|`replaceOwner`| `owner : address, newOwner : address` | To replace `owner` with `newOwner` as an owner of the multisig contract. |
|`changeRequirement`| `_required : uint` | To update the number of signatures required for a transaction to be executed. |

#### Action functions

| Name | Params | Description |
|--|--|--|
|`submitTransaction`| `destination : address, value : uint, data : bytes` | To submit a transaction that when executed will `call()` the `destination` address with `value` msg.value and `data` msg.data. |
|`confirmTransaction`| `transactionId : uint` | Sign off an existing transaction. |
|`revokeConfirmation`| `transactionId : Uint32` | Revoke signature off an existing transaction. |
|`executeTransaction`| `transactionId : Uint32` | Execute an existing transaction. |

## Potential signature pitfalls

* Order cannot be enforced on the signed transactions.
* Transactions could potentially be invalidated by sending a previously signed transaction by using the same nonce, if one chooses to do that they can only be sure once it is executed and risk other errors, it is recommended for one to be very sure before executing a transaction.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you are using node version 8.x.
NOTE: node 8.x is not available via Homebrew. Instead install nvm and use it to install node 8.x (Instructions found [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script)).

install nvm:
`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash`

install node 8.x (in this example, node 8.11.1):
`nvm install 8.11.1`

### Installation
install truffle:
`npm install -g truffle`

install ganache-cli:
`npm install -g ganache-cli`

clone the repo and cd into it
`git clone https://github.com/Xfers/Xfers-XSGD.git`

install project npm dependencies:
`npm install`

create .env file
`touch .env`

edit the .env file
`vi .env`

#### .env considerations

-   For local ganache testing, you only need to specify a random THROWAWAY_ADDRESS.
-   If you wish to deploy to mainnet or testnets, you will also need to specify DEPLOYER_MNEMONIC, ACCESS_TOKEN and ADDRESSES.
-   DEPLOYER_MNEMONIC is the mnemonic of a HD wallet with which the deployer account is the first address. This deployer account will be used for deploying the contracts and should already have some ETH in it. If you do not have this, you can generate a mnemonic [here](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/#english) and get some testnet eth from this [faucet](https://faucet.metamask.io/).
-   ACCESS_TOKEN is your infura project id. If you do not have one, please make an account on the [official infura website](https://infura.io/) and create a project.
-   Since each role will be controlled by a multisig, ADDRESSES represents the list of owners to be used in each multisig.
-   See the example .env file below for a full example.

```

### Testing

All tests are run with:
`npm run truffle-test`

or run a specific file of tests with:
`npm run truffle-test -- [file]`

to generate test coverage on all tests run:
`npm test`

#### Contracts

The implementation uses 2 separate contracts - a proxy contract (`FiatTokenProxy.sol`)and an implementation contract(`FiatToken.sol`). This allows upgrading the contract, as a new implementation contact can be deployed and the Proxy updated to point to it.

#### FiatToken

The FiatToken offers a number of capabilities, which briefly are described below. There is a more [detailed design docs](./doc/tokendesign.md) in the `doc` folder.

##### Pausable

The entire contract can be frozen, in the event a serious bug is found or if there is a key compromise. No transfers can take place while the contract is paused. Access to the pause functionality is controlled by the `pauser` address.

##### Upgradable

A new implementation contract can be deployed, and the proxy contract will forward calls to the new contract. Access to the upgrade functionality is guarded by a `proxyOwner` address. Only the `proxyOwner` address can change the `proxyOwner` address.

##### Blacklist

The contract can blacklist certain addresses which will prevent those addresses from transferring or receiving tokens. Access to the blacklist functionality is controlled by the `blacklister` address.

##### Minting/Burning

Tokens can be minted or burned on demand. The contract supports having multiple minters simultaneously. There is a `masterMinter` address which controls the list of minters and how much each is allowed to mint. The mint allowance is similar to the ERC20 allowance - as each minter mints new tokens their allowance decreases. When it gets too low they will need the allowance increased again by the `masterMinter`.

##### Ownable

The contract has an Owner, who can change the `owner`, `pauser`, `blacklister`, or `masterMinter` addresses. The `owner` can not change the `proxyOwner` address.

## Trust Model

There are many privileged roles in with the ability to make critical modifications to the smart contract like the `owner`, `masterMinter` and `blackLister`. As a regulated entity, our actions are held to high standards - read more [here](https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/fid/institution/detail/226546-XFERS-PTE-LTD). Moreover, we have also put in place multiple measures to ensure that these roles are secured, such as restricted access, no single point of failure, regular third party attestations and even contingency plans to handle the unlikely event of a compromise of any of these privileged roles.
